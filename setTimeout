function greet() {
    console.log("hello world");
}

setTimeout(greet, 4 * 1000);
The code defines a function and uses
setTimeout to delay its execution.



/////////////////////////////
function greet() {
    console.log("hello world");
}

function greetAlient() {
    console.log("hello alien");
}

setTimeout(greetAlient, 4 * 1000);
The code defines two functions and schedules 
the execution of one of 
them (greetAlient) using setTimeout after a specified delay.


Combined Summary:
Both parts use setTimeout to schedule the execution of a function after a delay.
In the first part, the greet function is called after a delay of 4 seconds, logging "hello world" to the console.
In the second part, two functions (greet and greetAlient) are defined, and setTimeout is used to call greetAlient after a 4-second delay, logging "hello alien" to the console.
These examples showcase how setTimeout can be used to introduce delays in the execution of functions in JavaScript.
